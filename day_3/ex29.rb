#What do you think the if does to the code under it?
#the if statment works by teling the computer if something then do something

#Why does the code under the if need to be indented two spaces?
#is indented becaus it's what the if statment un top needs to do if is true and to keep track
#if statement that may be in the same block.

#What happens if it isn't indented?
#it works normally so is just if you have anoher if statement in the same block.

#Can you put other boolean expressions from Exercise 27 in the if-statement? Try it.

#What happens if you change the initial values for people, cats, and dogs?
